# PyChat

PyChat is a Discord bot created by nickel_24 on Discord for CyberMyth. If you are interested in a tech community or interested in seeing this bot in action, contact me for more information. 

PyChat is currently in its VERY early stages of development. Only a few features have been added, as not much has been decided yet on its exact features. 

The purpose of the bot is to liven up all servers by providing funny (or not so funny) jokes, conversation starters to revive your chats, icebreakers to get the ball rolling and meet new people, and more that is to come. Its overall functionality is an entertainment bot for community servers. 

PyChat is currently protected by license CC-BY-NC. 

Anyone may take what is published here and use it anywhere else and change it how they want. However, I must receive proper credit, and my work is not to be distributed commercially by other parties without explicit permission.
